                        The Oakton Robotics Club was founded in 2001 by Mr. Scholla, and over the course 
                        of 2 decades, the robotics club thrived and transformed a competitive club with a 
                        diverse group of over 70 students. Originally the Oakton Rocketry, Jets, and Robotics 
                        clubs, Robotics remained the strongest of the 3, and as such became the spearhead of 
                        STEM clubs at Oakton High School. As a club, we pride ourselves on our competitive drive, 
                        along with ensuring that our students have the tools to succeed no matter what they do. 
                        Supported by our sponsors, parent board, mentor program, and hardworking students, the 
                        Oakton Robotics Club cements itself as one of the strongest extracurricular programs that 
                        Oakton has to offer.

                        for youth to pursue STEM related fields of study and careers. Our club's foundation is 
                        firmly built on interpersonal relationships between students, mentors, sponsorships, and 
                        our community. Finally, we strive to make a positive impact on our local community and the 
                        world. Though we are a robotics team, one of our focuses is people. It has been proven with time 
                        that communication, collaboration, and diversity allows us to triumph and overcome obstacles, 
                        and strive to create a space in which everyone is able to share their ideas. Different

                        Cougar Robotics is organized into 4 major categories: FRC, FTC, Business, and R&D. Students newer 
                        to robotics generally start on one of our FTC teams, or opt to join our growing Business team and R&D, 
                        team while the more experienced students focus on the FRC team. The Business Team works year round, 
                        assisting both FTC teams during the “winter” season and the FRC during the “spring” season. 
                        Similar to other clubs, we have a Board made up of students and adults. The composition of the 
                        Board includes the President, Treasurer, Secretary, Alumnus, and the Advisor. All adults are 
                        automatically included into the Board. Last but certainly not least, our mentors encourage teamwork 
                        and help to maintain a positive atmosphere. They help spark career interest and pursue STEM careers.

                        As a competitive robotics team, we strive to accept a variety of members that have a fierce passion 
                        for STEM. We acknowledge that teams with diverse skill sets and perspectives more effectively 
                        accomplish tasks. In order to attract potential recruits, the Cougar Robotics Team advertises 
                        itself at the local high school club fair. After filling out an interest form, students and 
                        parents are invited to an interest meeting where they learn about our team, our accomplishments, 
                        and acceptance criteria. Students who continue to express interest in the team then fill out an 
                        application form. Mentors and student leadership interview those students, asking about past STEM 
                        experience, their ability to work in teams, and give the applicant the opportunity to display their 
                        passion for the team they wish to join. Applicants have the opportunity to join our programming, 
                        build, business, or R&D team. The former will be placed into one of two FTC teams. Once they have sufficient 
                        experience, they may be placed in our FRC team. Students’ parents are encouraged to become mentors, 
                        fostering teamwork, helping to maintain a positive atmosphere, and sparking career interests with their 
                        own expertise and experiences in the field.

                        In Cougar Robotics, we pride ourselves in promoting gracious professionalism, student leadership, and 
                        STEM ideals for all. As our future in FIRST continues, we look to further expand into our community and 
                        provide an opportunity for students to learn what robotics has to offer. Each year, we make adjustments 
                        to make our teams run more fluidly and improve our process. This year, changes in structure were made for 
                        the Business Team to allow those documenting the engineering process to gather more detailed and accurate 
                        information. These adjustments strengthen our team as a whole and we will continue to make changes and 
                        improvements to Cougar Robotics.
