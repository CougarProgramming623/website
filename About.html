			<h2>Oakton Robotics</h2>
			In the year 2001, a man named Mr. Scholla created a Robotics Club at Oakton High School. However, the official name for the club was called OHSRRJ which stood for Oakton High School Robotics, Rocketry, and Jets. During the initial inception, the Robotics Team members participated in Robotics, Rocketry, and Jets. There were so many students interested in all three clubs that they actually had to have a cut off on how many students could be able to participate. The club continued to be organized like this for a great number of years. Students were full of team spirit and most importantly interested in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). <br><br> A few years later, the Jets Club was disbanded due to lack of interest. The Jets Club was impacted the most but, the robotics and rocketry clubs lost many of their members. Between the years 2010 - 2015 the robotics club had at most twenty students participating in the club and at most ten of them would show up regularly for meetings.
<br><br> As the interest in computer science and technology has grown, so has the interest of Oakton High School students which now has 53 members participating in the Robotics Club. Now in the school year of 2016-2017 the club has an amazing turnout of students during our weekly meetings. Our club meets Mondays and Saturdays at 6:30pm to 9:00pm and Saturdays at 9:00am to 12:00pm. We pride our self's as a club not to discriminate students by their grade or gender and let everyone have the right to participate in FTC or FRC competitions. As well as revamping the club, we have parent board members who deal with sponsorship donations, buying supplies we need, registering for FIRST events and always allows the club to run smoothly. Apart from the Parent board, there is also a student board which designates team leaders to complete the job they were assigned to depending on their field of experts. But not only are parents and students involved, we also have several mentors from all kinds of fields graciously volunteering their time. And with all the new changes to the club this year, we are hopeful that we will be able to set a new example for years to come in Oakton High School robotics.
